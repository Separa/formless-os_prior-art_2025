35 U.S.C. §102 and analogous statutes worldwide, preventing third parties from patenting
substantially identical ideas.

## Novel concepts covered by this disclosure

### Arch Platform (agentic swarm orchestration system)
- Agentic swarm orchestration of specialist AI agents under an LLM project‑lead  
- LLM‑directed development engine that plans, codes, tests, and integrates software end‑to‑end  
- Parallel code development via domain‑specialist swarms  
- Memory‑integrated swarm learning that accumulates reusable knowledge across projects  
- Automatic swarm self‑patching (continuous detect‑and‑fix loop)  
- Ablation‑tuned language development for prompt/strategy optimisation  
- Dynamic obfuscation‑based IP protection built into the generation pipeline  

### Formless OS (LLM‑centric operating system)
- Context‑derived modular UI that assembles itself on demand  
- LLM‑as‑kernel orchestrator that interprets intent and coordinates system actions  
- Hardware intent inference for proactive resource optimisation  
- Intent‑driven sandbox enforcement providing goal‑scoped security  
- Generative computing paradigm that eliminates static applications in favour of on‑the‑fly tools
